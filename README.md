Not everything fits nicely into a library. This is were I keep miscellaneous bits of code which might be nice to have on hand in the future. Each .swift file is designed to work on mostly it's own, but that's probably not how I'd use it. These aren't designed to be imported as a package or module into your project. You can copy/paste or whatever. It's better to think of them as pages in a [fake book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_book).
