Since not everything fits nicely into a library this is were I keep miscellaneous bits of code which might be nice to have on hand. These aren't designed to be imported as a package or module into your project. You can copy/paste or whatever. It's better to think of these files as pages in a [fake book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_book).
