# One Developer's Personal Swift Vocabulary


### Somewhere between a [fake book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_book) and a [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing))

These bits of code aren't designed to be imported as a package or module into your project. If the items in tgrabhis repo were sophisticated enough to be wrapped up as a model, they wouldn't be in this miscellaneous-drawer of a repo. Grab the file for your project and make it fit there.

That's not to say these files aren't designed to be used without modification. They can be. Each .swift file is designed to work on it's own. Or feel free to grab and modify snippets. Whatever.
