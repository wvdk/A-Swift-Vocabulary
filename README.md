This is one developer's personal swift vocabulary. Each .swift file is designed to work on mostly it's own, but that's probably not how I'd use it. These bits of code aren't designed to be imported as a package or module into your project. You can copy/paste or whatever. It's better to think of them as pages in a [fake book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_book).
